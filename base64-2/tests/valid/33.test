CHAPTER X DURING THE entr'acte a whiff of cold air came into Hlne's box, the door opened, and Ana- tole entered, stooping and trying not to brush against anyone. "Let me introduce my brother to you," said Hlne, her eyes shifting uneasily from Na- tdsha to Anatole. Natdsha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officer and smiled at him over her bare shoulder. Anatole, who was as handsome at close quarters as at a distance, sat down beside her and told her he had long wished to have this happinessever since the Naryshkins' ball in fact, at which he had had the well-remembered pleasure of seeing her. Kurdgin was much more sensible and simple with women than among men. He talked bold- ly and naturally, and Natasha was strangely and agreeably struck by the fact that there was nothing formidable in this man about whom there was so much talk, but that on the con- trary his smile was most nai've, cheerful, and good-natured. Kurdgin asked her opinion of the perform- ance and told her how at a previous perform- ance Semenova had fallen down on the stage. "And do you know, Countess," he said, sud- denly addressing her as an old, familiar ac- quaintance, "we are getting up a costume tour- nament; you ought to take part in it! It will be great fun. We shall all meet at the Kardgins'l Please come! No! Really, eh?" said he. While saying this he never removed his smil- ing eyes from her face, her neck, and her bare arms. Natdsha knew for certain that he was en- raptured by her. This pleased her, yet his pres- ence made her feel constrained and oppressed. When she was not looking at him she felt that he was looking at her shoulders, and she involuntarily caught his eye so that he should look into hers rather than this. But looking in- to his eyes she was frightened, realizing that there was not that barrier of modesty she had always felt between herself and other men. She did not know how it was that within five min- utes she had come to feel herself terribly near to this man. When she turned away she feared he might seize her from behind by her bare arm and kiss her on the neck. They spoke of most ordinary things, yet she felt that they were clos- er to one another than she had ever been to any man. Natdsha kept turning to Hdene and to her father, as if asking what it all meant, but He*lene was engaged in conversation with a general and did not answer her look, and her father's eyes said nothing but what they always said: "Having a good time? Well, I'm glad of it!" During one of these moments of awkward silence when Anatole's prominent eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her, Natdsha, to break the silence, asked him how he liked Mos- cow. She asked the question and blushed. She felt all the time that by talking to him she was doing something improper. Anatole smiled as though to encourage her. "At first I did not like it much, because what makesa townpleasantcejorcf lesjoliesjemmes? isn't that so? But now I like it very much in- deed," he said, looking at her significantly. "You'll come to the costume tournament, Countess? Do come!" and putting out his hand to her bouquet and dropping his voice, he add- ed, "You will be the prettiest there. Do come, dear countess, and give me this flower as a pledge!" 1 Are the pretty women. BOOK EIGHT 321
