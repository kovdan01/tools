existed for him now. That search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared tempo- rarilyhe felt that it no longer existed for him and could not present itself again. And this very absence of an aim gave him the complete, joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at this time. He could not see an aim, for he now had faith not faith in any kind of rule, or words, or ideas, but faith in an ever-living, ever- manifest God. Formerly he had sought Him in aims he set himself. That search for an aim had been simply a search for God, and suddenly in his captivity he had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what his nurse had told him long ago: that God is here and everywhere. In his captivity he had learned that in Karatdev God was greater, more infinite and unfathomable than in the Architect of the Universe recognized by the Freemasons. He felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see into the far dis- tance finds what he sought at his very feet.

But even then, at moments of weakness as he had accounted them, his mind had penetrated to those dis- tances and he had there seen the same petti- ness, worldliness, and senselessness. Now, how- ever, he had learned to see the great, eternal, and infinite in everything, and therefore to see it and enjoy its contemplation he natu- rally threw away the telescope through which he had till now gazed over men's heads, and gladly regarded the ever-changing, eternally great, unfathomable, and infinite life around him. And the closer he looked the more tran- quil and happy he became. That dreadful ques- tion, "What for?" which had formerly destroyed all his mental edifices, no longer existed for him. To that question, "What for?" a simple answer was now always ready in his soul: "Be- cause there is a God, that God without whose
