their own way, the rumors current among the people of an invasion by Antichrist, and though Julie (now Princess Drubetskdya), who had re- sumed correspondence with her, wrote patri- otic letters from Moscow. "I write you in Russian, my good friend," wrote Julie in her Frenchified Russian, "be- cause I have a detestation for all the French, and the same for their language which I can- not support to hear spoken We in Moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored Em- peror. "My poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in Jewish taverns, but the news which I have inspires me yet more. "You heard probably of the heroic exploit of Rae* vski, embracing his two sons and saying: 'I will perish with them but we will not be shaken!' And truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we, we were unshakable. We pass the time as we can, but in war as in war! The princesses Aline and Sophie sit whole days with me, and we, unhappy widows of live men, make beautiful conversations over our char pie, only you, my friend, are missing ..." and so on. The chief reason Princess Mary did not re- alize the full significance of this war was that the old prince never spoke of it, did not recog- nize it, and laughed at Dessalles when he men- tioned it at dinner. The prince's tone was so calm and confident that Princess Mary un- hesitatingly believed him. All that July the old prince was exceedingly active and even animated. He planned anoth- er garden and began a new building for the domestic serfs. The only thing that made Prin- cess Mary anxious about him was that he slept very little and, instead of sleeping in his study as usual, changed his sleeping place every day. One day he would order his camp bed to be set up in the glass gallery, another day he re- mained on the couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there without un- dressing, while instead of Mademoiselle Bou- rienne a serf boy read to him. Then again he would spend a night in the dining room.
