approximately. When one of the opinions ex- pressed is fulfilled, that opinion gets connected with the event as a command preceding it. Men are hauling a log. Each of them ex- presses his opinion as to how and where to haul it. They haul the log away, and it hap- pens that this is done as one of them said. He ordered it. There we have command and pow- er in their primary form. The man who worked most with his hands could not think so much about what he was doing, or reflect on or com- mand what would result from the common activity; while the man who commanded more would evidently work less with his hands on account of his greater verbal activity. When some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aim there is a yet sharper division of those who, because their activity is given to directing and commanding, take less part in the direct work. When a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections which as it seems to him directed his past activity, justify his pres- ent activity, and guide him in planning his future actions. Just the same is done by a con- course of people, allowing those who do not take a direct part in the activity to devise considerations, justifications, and surmises con- cerning their collective activity. For reasons known or unknown to us the French began to drown and kill one another. And corresponding to the event its justifica- tion appears in people's belief that this was necessary for the welfare of France, for liberty, and for equality. People ceased to kill one another, and this event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a central- ization of power, resistance to Europe, and so on. Men went from the west to the east killing their fellow men, and the event was accom- panied by phrases about the glory of France, the baseness of England, and so on. History shows us that these justifications of the events have no common sense and are all contradic- tory, as in the case of killing a man as the re- sult of recognizing his rights, and the killing of millions in Russia for the humiliation of England. But these justifications have a very necessary significance in their own day. These justifications release those who pro- duce the events from moral responsibility. These temporary aims are like the broom fixed
